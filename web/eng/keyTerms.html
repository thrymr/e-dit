<h2>Political Parties in the National Assembly</h2>
<p><b>CHP (The Republican People’s Party):</b> Founded by Ataturk and his comrades, CHP dominated 
Turkey’s political sphere until 1946 when Turkey started the transition to a “multiple-party” 
democratic system. The party has maintained a secular/Kemalist line to this day, and is therefore in 
strong opposition to the arrest of former army generals. Also, CHP is currently the main opposition 
party in the National Assembly. Branded as a “social democrat” party, CHP has had troubles over the 
past decades to have a strong say in the government. However, the party’s solid voter base allows 
them to enter the National Assembly in every election. <b>Chairman: Kemal Kilicdaroglu. Political 
Affiliation: Social Democrat, Center Left.</b></p>

<p><b>AKP (Justice and Development Party):</b> Founded in 2001 by the incumbent PM Recep Tayyip 
Erdogan, AKP has been in power since the November 2002 elections. The party’s founding members were 
those who were kicked out of office after the “post-modern” coup of February 28, 1997 – when the 
rule of the Welfare Party came to an end. The Islamist party divided into two wings after the coup – 
the traditionalist wing (hard line conservative Islamists) and the reformists (liberal Islamists). 
The founders of AKP comprised the reformist wing of the Welfare Party, and upon their resignation 
from the party, they founded their own. Although their liberal democratic approach to politics 
commenced a new era in Turkey, the hopes of ending the military domination in politics have now 
transformed into a fear of AKP domination and oppression. <b>Chairman: Recep Tayyip Erdogan. 
Political Affiliation: Liberal Islamist, Center Right.</b></p> 

<p><b>BDP (Peace and Democracy Party):</b> Strongly opposed to assimilation, BDP is known for its 
outspoken criticism of the government’s rejection to grant the Kurds equal rights as the Turks. 
Among these rights are those such as education in mother tongue, accepting Kurdish along with 
Turkish as the official language of the country, granting democratic autonomy to the southeastern 
region of Turkey and more. The parliamentarians from BDP include former columnists like Sirri 
Sureyya Onder, renowned socialist activists of the 1970s like Ertugrul Kurkcu and other Kurdish 
businessmen. While no organic connection between the BDP and the PKK has been proven, the party 
refuses to articulate the PKK as a terrorist organization, thus receiving criticism from the 
Turkish circles for “favoring violence against the state.” Many Kurdish affiliated political parties 
have been shut down by the Turkish courts, last of which was the DTP (Democratic Society Party) in 
2009. <b>Chairman: Selahattin Demirtas. Political Affiliation: Liberal Democrat, Left.</b></p>  

<p><b>MHP (The Nationalist Movement Party):</b> Founded in 1969, the party follows a strict Turkish 
nationalist and Islamist policy line. Although their presence in the Turkish political sphere has 
been less than impressive over the past decade, the party saw a rise in the number of votes they r
eceived in the last elections. However, due to the new election law, this increase in the number of 
votes was not reflected in the number of parliamentarians they manage to put in the Assembly, on the 
contrary, bringing it down. While MHP groups took occasional violent approaches to the Kurdish 
issue, the party has taken a quiet stance toward ethnic issues in Turkey since their current 
chairman became the party leader in 1997. <b>Chairman: Devlet Bahceli. Political Affiliation: 
Conservative, Far Right.</b></p>

<h2>The Controversial Topics of Debate in Turkey</h2>

<p><b>The Ergenekon Trial:</b> “Ergenekon” is the name given to an alleged Kemalist 
ultra-nationalist organization in Turkey with ties to the country’s military and security forces. 
The name itself represents a mythical place in East-Central Asia where the first Turks are believed 
to have emerged. Since 2008, over 300 people have been affiliated with the organization in court 
indictments including those arrested, acquitted and those who have had their homes searched by the 
police officers. The organization is accused of employing violent measures to destabilize the 
“unwanted” governments of Turkey.</p>

<p><b>The Balyoz (Sledgehammer) Trial:</b> “Balyoz” is the name of an alleged military coup that dates 
back to 2003. According to the allegations, a secularist military coup was planned around 2003, and 
plans to justify this coup included the bombing of two mosques in Istanbul and accusing Greece of 
shooting down a military plane over the Aegean Sea. The chaos arising from these two drastic events 
would then justify the military coup. Furthermore, while the army admitted that the plans had been 
discussed, but only as a “planning exercise” at a seminar, which bore no possibility of having been 
carried out in real life. Over 150 people, mostly military members including retired generals and 
admirals, have been issued arrest warrants as of February 2011.</p> 

<p><b>The KCK (Union of Communities in Kurdistan) Operations:</b> Since April 2009, nearly 2,000 
people have been charged with and accused of being members of an illegal organization in the KCK 
operations carried out by the Turkish security forces. In addition, thousands of others were put in 
prison without a trial (pre-trial detention). While many academicians, students, human rights 
lawyers and politicians are among the accused, KCK itself is an organization founded by Abdullah 
Ocalan to lay the foundations of democratic confederalism.</p>
