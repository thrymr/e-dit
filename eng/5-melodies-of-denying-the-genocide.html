<h2>5 Melodies of Denying the Genocide</h2>
<i>Ali Topuz – Radikal, 24.04.2012</i>

<p>It is difficult to talk about 1915, but impossible to shut up about it. There are two ways that make 
it easy to talk about 1915; the state-preferred way of <b>denial</b>, and <b>mourning</b> that is preferred by 
those who do not want to be partners of the genocide crime.</p>

<p>Those who prefer <b>denial</b> use the “we should leave it to the historians” argument every time they are 
cornered with discussions. “Those who say this know well enough that history is more important than 
merely leaving it to the historians. That is why they immediately add ‘our ancestors would commit 
genocide’.”</p>

<p>All known attempts of genocide are organized by the state or a similar organization and are carried 
out by that. “One example is enough: The Nazi atrocities were not blamed upon all Germans.” That is 
why saying that there was a genocide in 1915 puts forth the attitudes and behaviors of the statesmen 
at the time. Defending ourselves with a rhetoric that our ancestors would not do something like that 
is prohibiting any discussion even before it starts. This argument carries all the codes of the 
ideological Turk-Islam synthesis doctrine that started being taught during the time of Abdulhamit in 
1915 and was revised and updated after September 12, 1980 (coup).</p>

<p>Also, saying that our ancestors would not commit genocide is saying that the Armenians that lived 
here once upon a time are not our ancestors. While this immediately excludes the Armenian citizens 
in the country, it also discloses the codes of the 1915 mentality; “There must be two ethnicities in 
order for genocide to happen: a strong one affiliated with the government to be praised and 
protected, and a weak one to be destroyed and despised. A race that is not from us, and not us.”</p>

<p>Another group argues that genocide is a legal term, and that the legal terms could not be employed 
backwards. Since there was no such terminology prior to the Holocaust, the events of 1915 could not 
be defined as genocide either, according to them.</p>

<p>This kind of “extremely positivist” thinking would do nothing but commence an Olympiad of thoughts 
that would make it impossible to deal with crimes against humanity, and, naturally, against 
genocide.</p>

<p>Then there are those who say that the imperialist powers are exploiting the issue. There is nothing 
that the imperialist powers do not exploit. “Exactly for this reason it should be mandatory to 
oppose the denial of 1915: Because opposing 1915 is opposing the homogenizing nation-state 
mentality, and, therefore, opposing imperialism and its spirit.</p> 

<p>Then there is the blaming of the Armenian Diaspora. When this is mentioned, it is as though someone 
is talking about the devil. One of the most common forms of mentioning the Diaspora is: “Actually, 
it is not difficult for us to get along with Armenia, but this Diaspora…” And another one: “We do 
not have any problems with our Armenians, but this Diaspora…”</p>

<p>Talking about Diaspora and ‘our Armenians’ in different terms is like saying Armenians are not from 
us, or that they belong to us.</p>

<p>There is only one condition that would make it possible to criticize a group’s demand for their 
historic right for having been subjected to destruction; “Stop denying 1915, open the path to 
return, announce that you are ready for re-compensation, ask for forgiveness, and mourn. Then nobody 
would need the ‘devil Diaspora’ fairytale anyway.</p>
